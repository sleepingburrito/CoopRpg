I was at one point working on a co-op pokemon game. I stopped because I didn’t want Nintendo to sue me. :P Its made in js and html 5 and uses nodejs as the server.

Its a little laggy but npcs should stay synced the best the can. You can also choose your players sprite.

This is a webased co-op topdown rpg style engine. I only got to the overworld, I did not feel like working on a game I could not really share. 

I have uploaded all my code here minus the Pokemon graphics. Code is all MIT licensed.
